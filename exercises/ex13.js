/*
In this activity, we will be converting date strings like "2017/12/02", into more English friendly date strings like December 2nd, 2017.

Talking Calendar
We will be given a date as a string (not a Date object). The date will always be formatted as YYYY/MM/DD. We will have to parse the given string and produce a human readable date.

Instruction
Create a function named talkingCalendar that takes in a date string with the format YYYY/MM/DD, and returns a new human readable date that looks like December 2nd, 2017.

  // Your code here
  let [year, month, day] = date.split("/");
  month = parseInt(month);
  day = parseInt(day);
